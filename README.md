# A Multiplayer Shooting Game for the Oculus Rift

This is a quick build put together for Jikhan Jung. While the assignment required us to build the project for the Vive, I built it for the Rift. 
This was due to the availability of the Rift. Porting to the Vive shouldn't be too hard but requires insuring we acount for common button mappings.
The game waits until two players have join and then starts an invaders like game where you're attacked by spasmic color changing cubes. The objective
is to kill them only to be faced with more waves of cubes. How existential!
